# 🧠 Day 1 Notes — Introduction to Google ADK Agents

These are my personal notes from **Day 1** of learning the **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)** and **Gemini models**.  
The focus for today was on understanding the **core idea of AI agents**, exploring how they function, and getting hands-on by building my **first working agent** on Kaggle.

## 🎯 What I Learned

- **AI Agents ≠ Chatbots.**
  Agents can not only respond to prompts but also **plan, take actions, and learn from outcomes.**

- **Core agent loop:**  
  `Reason → Act → Observe → Improve`

- **Google ADK** simplifies agent development by providing built-in tools, environments, and interfaces.

- **Gemini models** serve as the *reasoning engine* behind the agent — enabling understanding, decision-making, and response generation.

- **ADK agents can use tools** (like Google Search or custom APIs) to gather live or contextual data.

## ⚙️ What I Did Practically

1. Set up the **Gemini API key** in Kaggle using secrets.
2. Installed and imported the **ADK library**.
3. Created my first **agent instance** using the Gemini model.
4. Gave it basic tasks (like answering queries or summarizing data).
5. Observed how the agent broke down tasks and reasoned through them.
6. Explored the **ADK Web Interface** to view the agent’s thought process.

## 💡 Key Takeaways from Whitepaper

- The ADK promotes **modular agent design**, so each agent can specialize in one task.
- It focuses on **transparency and debugging** — letting us inspect the reasoning path.
- **Multi-agent systems** can collaborate to solve complex workflows.
- The goal is to create **reliable, reusable, and observable** AI systems.

## 🎧 Podcast Insights

- The podcast emphasized that we’re entering a new phase of AI — **“agents that act”** instead of “models that respond.”
- Google’s ADK helps bridge research and practical application.
- The early experiments show how agents can **autonomously complete real-world tasks** with supervision.

---

## 🧩 Concepts That Stood Out

- **Observation Loop** — every agent learns from its outcomes.
- **Tools Integration** — makes the agent’s actions more powerful.
- **Context Awareness** — agents can maintain a sense of history or memory.
- **Ethical Design** — transparency and safety are built into the ADK principles.

## 🏁 Summary

Day 1 gave me a solid foundation on:
- What makes an agent different from an LLM  
- How Gemini powers intelligent reasoning  
- How ADK provides structure for experimentation  

Next, I’ll explore **Day 2**, focusing on **multi-agent collaboration** and deeper customization.
